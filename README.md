# **White House Logs EDA**


**Project Overview**

This notebook explores visitor log data for the White House, focusing on identifying patterns in visits, key individuals, and organizational affiliations over time. The dataset contains records with visitor names, appointment times, and associated organizations. The goal was to better understand the dynamics of White House visits, such as peak periods, the most frequent guests, and the organizations they represent.

**Methods & Results**

I began by cleaning and formatting the dataset, standardizing date and time fields for accurate analysis. Exploratory visualizations highlighted trends in visit frequency across months and years, revealing distinct peaks in activity that aligned with certain political or seasonal events. The most frequent visitors and organizations were ranked, showing patterns of repeated engagement with specific departments. Additionally, a breakdown of visit timing within each day helped identify the busiest hours for scheduled appointments.

**Key Outputs**

- Cleaned and structured White House visitor log dataset
- Visualizations of visit frequency over time
- Rankings of most frequent visitors and organizations
- Hourly patterns showing peak visit times

**Conclusion**

The analysis provided insight into the flow of White House visitors, revealing not only when visits are most common but also which individuals and groups are most actively engaged. These findings can be used for further political, historical, or operational research, especially when paired with additional contextual datasets.
